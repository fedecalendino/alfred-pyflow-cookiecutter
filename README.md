### FILE STRUCTURE

Anything can be changed after the cookiecutter is used by following this folder structure:

* **dist**: directory where the binaries are generated.
    * the idea behind this is to avoid the need of installing any dependency for future users of the workflow.
* **src**: directory where all your python source code files should be.
* **build.sh**: bash script used to generate binary files.
    * can be edited to generate more binaries if needed (one binary per executable py file).
* **icon.png**: image used by **alfred** for the workflow's icon.
* **info.plist**: file generated by **alfred** for the configuration of the workflow (*should not be edited by hand*).
* **LICENSE**: MIT license file generated for the workflow.
* **poetry.lock**: file generated by **poetry** (*should not be edited by hand*, use `poetry update` instead).
* **pyproject.toml**: file used by poetry to describe the project.
* **README.md**: markdown file where you should add some documentation of the workflow and how to use it.
